Although in vitro studies found CYP2D6*2 had enzyme activity ranging from similar to decreased activity compared to wildtype, the in vitro data was not convincing as the differences in results may be due to differences in the expression system used (11266079, 18784265, 24647041, 25469868, 26310775, 26542054, 26652007, 26937172, 26968424, 27203132, 27251229, 27354764, 27538917, 30366777).

CYP2D6*3 was first described in a heterozygous subject demonstrating decreased sparteine metabolism based on an elevated urinary metabolite ratio. CYP2D6*3 is defined by a single nucleotide deletion causing a frameshift and resulting in a nonfunctional protein (2211621).

CYP2D6*5 has been studied for more than 20 years and its association with impaired function is well-established (1673290, 31544239). CYP2D6*5 is defined by a deletion of the CYP2D6 gene. CYP2D6*5 was first identified in a homozygous subject demonstrating decreased sparteine metabolism (1673290). An additional study found liver samples of seven subjects heterozygous for CYP2D6*5 demonstrated decreased intrinsic clearance compared to wildtype with a bufuralol substrate (11266079).

CYP2D6*7 was first described in subjects demonstrating decreased sparteine metabolism (7845481). Two in vitro studies found CYP2D6*7 had nondetectable or markedly decreased enzyme activity compared to wildtype with tamoxifen, bufuralol, dextromethorphan, and primaquine substrates (24647041, 30366777). CYP2D6*7 is defined by an amino substitution near the active site disrupting protein folding and resulting in a nonfunctional enzyme based on computational analysis (7845481).

CYP2D6*9 was first identified in a liver sample with decreased protein expression and enzyme activity (1844820). Subjects with CYP2D6*9 demonstrated decreased debrisoquine metabolism but greater metabolism compared to subjects with no function alleles based on urine metabolites, indicating there is not a complete loss of enzyme function (8101460). Similarly, liver microsomes of two subjects with CYP2D6*4/*9 and CYP2D6 *1/*9 genotype demonstrated decreased intrinsic clearance compared to wildtype with a bufuralol substrate (11266079). Two in vitro studies found CYP2D6*9 had a modest decrease in intrinsic clearance compared to wildtype (24647041, 30366777). Although one in vitro experiment found CYP2D6*9 had similar activity compared to wildtype with various substrates, the result was not convincing as decreased protein expression in vivo likely contributes to decreased enzyme activity observed in subjects carrying the CYP2D6*9 allele (1844820). Pharmacogenomic clinical studies found the measured activity values for several substrates is reduced (0.34 (PMID 30312494), 0.18 (PMID 33792048), 0.28 (PMID 33792048), 0.22 (PMID 32599653); 0.46 PMID 33932135) and a lower activity value of 0.25 is warranted for most substrates.

CYP2D6*10 has consistently been described in subjects demonstrating decreased metabolism of various CYP2D6 substrates, with metabolic ratios greater than those observed in wildtype subjects but less than poor metabolizers (8764380, 8287064, 19364831). In vitro studies using different cell systems similarly found CYP2D6*10 demonstrates decreased intrinsic clearance compared to wildtype with various substrates (27538917, 27354764, 27251229, 27203132, 26968424, 26937172, 26652007, 26542054, 26310775, 25469868, 30366777, 24647041, 11266079, 18784265). As part of the standardization of CYP2D6 genotype to phenotype translation among CPIC and the Dutch Pharmacogenetics Working Group, CYP2D6*10 was reevaluated as the evidence suggests the activity of the CYP2D6*10 is considerably lower compared to other decreased function alleles and the activity value of 0.5 (previously assigned) may overestimate metabolic capacity of patients with this allele (31647186). Therefore, consensus among experts was decreased function with an activity value of 0.25 based on strong evidence.",
